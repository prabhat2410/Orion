Feature: get common metrics in Context Broker
  As a context broker user
  I would like get common metrics in Context Broker
  So that I can manage and use them in my scripts

  Actions Before the Feature:
  Setup: update properties test file from "epg_contextBroker.txt" and sudo local "false"
  Setup: update contextBroker config file
  Setup: start ContextBroker
  Check: verify contextBroker is installed successfully
  Check: verify mongo is installed successfully

  Actions After each Scenario:
  Setup: delete database "orion-test_incomingtransactions_1" in mongo
  Setup: delete database "orion-test_incomingtransactions_2" in mongo

  Actions After the Feature:
  Setup: stop ContextBroker

############## Metrics to implement:
#
#    incomingTransactions: number of requests consumed by the component.
#    incomingTransactionRequestSize: total size (bytes) in requests associated to incoming transactions (“in” from the point of view of the component).
#    incomingTransactionResponseSize: total size (bytes) in responses associated to incoming transactions (“out” from the point of view of the component).
#    incomingTransactionErrors: number of incoming transactions resulting in error.
#    serviceTime: average time to serve a transaction.
#    outgoingTransactions: number of requests sent by the component.
#    outgoingTransactionRequestSize: total size (bytes) in requests associated to outgoing transactions (“out” from the point of view of the component).
#    outgoingTransactionResponseSize: total size (bytes) in responses associated to outgoing transactions (“in” from the point of view of the component).
#    outgoingTransactionErrors: number of outgoing transactions resulting in error.
#
##############  WARNING:
#   This tests suite must be executed complete, because the counters are accumulative in the same CB session. If you execute a scenario alone will fail.
#   To execute individually a scenario, it is necessary to reset the metrics, so append these lines below of the "get common metrics" step:
#         | parameter | value |
#         | reset     | true  |
#   and modify the number of incoming Transactions expected in each verification step.
