Feature: verify notifications from subscriptions with different expires, throttling and status values using NGSIv2
  As a context broker user
  I would like to verify notifications from subscriptions with different expires and status values using NGSIv2
  So that I can manage and use them in my scripts

  Actions Before the Feature:
  Setup: update properties test file from "epg_contextBroker.txt" and sudo local "false"
  Setup: update contextBroker config file
  Setup: start ContextBroker
  Check: verify contextBroker is installed successfully
  Check: verify mongo is installed successfully
  Setup: start the subscription listener as a daemon using the port "1045"

  Actions before each Scenario:
  Check: verify subscription listener is started successfully

  Actions After each Scenario:
  Setup: delete database in mongo

  Actions After the Feature:
  Setup: stop ContextBroker
