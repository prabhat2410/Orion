Feature: ServicePath for registrations (NGSI9) (not recursive)
  Background:
    Given the Context Broker started with multitenancy

  Scenario: Subscribe different entities with the same provider and services but different subservice
    # First registration
    Given a new "NGSI9" api request with the service "issue_719" and the subservice "/subservice1"
    And the following entities to consult
      | entity_id | entity_type |
      | Room1     | Room        |
      | Room2     | Room        |
    And the following attributes to consult
      | attribute_name | attribute_type |
      | att1           | att_type_1     |
    And a context registrations with the before entities and attributes and the following providing applications
      | providing_application |
      | /service1             |
    And build the standard context registration payload with the previous data and duration "P1M"
    And a standard context registration is asked with the before information
    # Second registration
    And a new "NGSI9" api request with the service "issue_719" and the subservice "/subservice2"
    And the following entities to consult
      | entity_id | entity_type |

    And a context registrations with the before entities and attributes and the following providing applications
      | providing_application |
      | /service2             |
    And build the standard context registration payload with the previous data and duration "P1M"
    And a standard context registration is asked with the before information
    # Discover
    And a new "NGSI9" api request with the service "issue_719" and the subservice "/subservice1"

      | entity_id | entity_type | is_pattern |
      | Room.*    | Room        | true       |
    And build the standard discover context availability payload with the previous data
    When a standard disconver context availability is asked with the before information
    Then check the response has the key "id" with the value "Room2"
    And check the response has not the key "id" with the value "Room3"
    And clean the mongo database of the service "issue_719"
