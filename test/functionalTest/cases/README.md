This directory contains several subdirectories. Each subdirectory starts with a number, which identifies the issue number at GitHub associated with the .test contained in that subdirectory (except the ones starting with `0000`, which are not associated with any GitHub issue).

Subdirectories can be classified in 3 groups:

* The ones with "ngsi10" substring in the name, corresponding to NGSI10 functionality.
* The ones with "ngsi9" substring in the name, corresponding to  NGSI9 functionality.
* The ones without "ngsi10" or "ngsi9" in the name, corresponding to functionalities not directly related to NGSI9 or NGSI10, because they are orthogonal (i.e. applicable to both) or are not related to NGSI (e.g. CLI tests).
